### Solitaire Revised

**Rules:**
Players are given to chance to bet for their survival in a game of solitaire. As long as the player solves the game under the maximum number of moves required, they will get double of their bet money back.
The game starts by showing the player the opening pile and asking how much money they want to bet; the player must enter a value above $50 if they wish to continue playing. The game then proceeds as normal solitaire. 
The player will lose all their bet money if not solved under the maximum number of moves, otherwise their bet money will be doubled.
The player can choose to continue playing by selecting ‘Yes’ when prompted after the end of each game. The game will only end when the player chooses ‘No’ after the end of a game or if the player’s balance is $0. 
Have fun!
